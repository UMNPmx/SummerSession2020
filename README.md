# UMN_R4PMx_2020
Summer 2020 R workshop for pharmacometrics related topics. Content put on by ECP senior students.

When: Mondays from 15th June to 3rd August (8 sessions)

Where: Zoom (Link will be sent by the moderator)

Time: Flexible based on the moderator (1-2 hours)

Format:
+ Sessions will be moderated by someone with decent experience on the topic.
+ Each moderator will provide the following at the start/during the course of the session:
		- A cheat-sheet on the day’s topic
		- An R-markdown file with incomplete code which attendees can code-along during the demonstration (like the one Kyle provided for the mrgsolve workshop). The moderator can also include a homework type exercise at the end, if they choose.
